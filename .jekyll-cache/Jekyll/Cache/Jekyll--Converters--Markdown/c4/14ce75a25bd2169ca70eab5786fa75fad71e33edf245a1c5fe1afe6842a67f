  <p>â€œArt and the ability to think of abstract concepts is what distinguishes our species from other animalsâ€¦ Its emergence, therefore, marks one of the key moments when our species became truly humanâ€ <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29415716">*</a></p>

  <p>â€œThe Caveâ€ is an interactive, projection-mapped installation debuted at Luna Fete 2016 that explores the dawn of art created by artificial intelligence- art made possible by new machine learning algorithms. By tweeting images to @paintingthecave, the audience spawns algorithmically-generated computer â€œcave paintingsâ€ that are embedded into the caveâ€™s digital mesh.</p>

  <p>For the tech savvy: the program employs convolutional neural networks to preserve the semantic content of the original tweet while rendering the image in the style of another (also algorithmically-generated) picture. For a complicated, in-depth explanation of neural-style art, <a href="https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf">check out this paper</a>.
