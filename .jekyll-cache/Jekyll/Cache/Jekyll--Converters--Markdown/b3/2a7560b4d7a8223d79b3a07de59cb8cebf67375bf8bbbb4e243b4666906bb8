<p>As online worlds increasingly infuse or supplant analog realities, the meaning of “exterior” in digital spaces finds new relevance. <a href="https://jdeboi.com/netscapes/#/">Netscapes</a> examines cyber-environments, and in particular, the extent to which digital representations of natural landscapes reflect existing values and attitudes towards nature.</p>

<p>Desktop wallpapers serve as a salient and sardonic example of the Anthropocene’s ethics. While climate change threatens to collapse global ecosystems and unravel the fabric of civilization, we paper desktops with uncannily-idyllic Caribbean beaches and rolling mountain ranges. We build captivating virtual worlds and mine cryptocurrencies on digital platforms that are abstracted away from the petrochemical infrastructure upon which they run.</p>

<p>Through interactive web vignettes built with recognizable user interfaces, I hope to subvert digital escape by injecting anthropogenic detritus into online spaces. Simultaneously, I hope to expose modes of extraction endemic to cyberspace (and late stage capitalism more broadly) so that we might arrive at a more responsible visual language for the web.</p>
