<p>Manic Bot is an interactive Processing program that attempts to blur the lines between human and machine by merging the content that I created during my psychotic break (which includes geolocations, social media posts, emails, and texts) with equally bizarre, frequently-nonsensical text and imagery generated by artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this work seeks to challenge our access to reality. By combining my own blabber with the algorithmic equivalent into this smartphone performance, I hope to ask: when did I lose Jenna and become a sputtering, psychotic bot? And equivalently, when will machines, with all their human-induced neuroses, become conscious?</p>

<p><a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/ethira">Amalia Ulman’s work, Ethira</a>, ultimately played a role in the ways I started thinking about the intersection of technology, mental health, movement, and surveillance. Ethira  was an iphone app that allowed users to post anonymous, geo-tagged messages that would delete soon after posting. by refusing to record any data about users, Ethira attempted to subvert surveillance capitalism, by which I mean the increasingly dominant economic system where tech companies commodify personal data.</p>

<p>The objective, in Ulman’s words, was to create an app where users could “shout into the void”. She writes: “Twitter seemed the go-to app for those with mental health issues… as a form of release. The problem with that though, is that …your problems become inseparable from your handle” <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/ethira">link</a>.</p>

<p>Ulman’s critical consideration of social media (in this case, in service of mental health) ultimately served as a bridge from Manic Bot to my critical examinations of surveillance.</p>
