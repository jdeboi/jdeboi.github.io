  <p>â€œArt and the ability to think of abstract concepts is what distinguishes our species from other animalsâ€¦ Its emergence, therefore, marks one of the key moments when our species became truly humanâ€ <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29415716">*</a></p>

  <p>â€œThe Caveâ€ is an interactive, projection-mapped installation that explores the dawn of art created by artificial intelligence- art made possible by new machine learning algorithms. By tweeting images to @paintingthecave, the audience spawns algorithmically-generated computer â€œcave paintingsâ€ that are embedded into the caveâ€™s digital mesh.</p>
