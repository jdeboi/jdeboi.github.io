“Art and the ability to think of abstract concepts is what distinguishes our species from other animals... Its emergence, therefore, marks one of the key moments when our species became truly human” [*](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29415716)

“The Cave” is an interactive, projection-mapped installation that explores the dawn of art created by artificial intelligence- art made possible by new machine learning algorithms. By tweeting images to @paintingthecave, the audience spawns algorithmically-generated computer “cave paintings” that are embedded into the cave’s digital mesh.
