"Neon Rivers" is a collaboration with visual and new media artist [Martin Benson](https://www.martinlbenson.com/), who originally conceived of the light installation. The project was commissioned by the Aloft hotel. Pulsing, vibrant colors illuminate the tributaries. As participants enter or exit the hotel, two Kinects track their movement, causing the LEDs above their positions begin to "glitch" in randomized, discordant colors.

The installation invites passersby to reflect on our tumultuous relationship with our watersheds, particularly in the Mississippi Delta.
