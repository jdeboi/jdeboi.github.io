[Kirasu](http://www.kirasumusic.com/) is a music, science, and art collaborative producing unique experiences inspired by a kind of divine physics hidden behind everything familiar. This show marked the group's debut, which involved projection mapped, interactive visuals paired with original music. I was responsible for creating the Processing sketch that controlled the visuals, including projection mapping, MIDI triggering, scene changes, and generative art.
